###Lesson 3 - Animation Principles 2

In the previous lesson you have learned the first 6 animation principles and have applied them on the animation of a bouncing ball. In this lesson we will continue to focus on basic animation principles and will examine the remaining 6:
 
- Anticipation
- Follow through and Overlapping action
- Staging
- Secondary Action
- Solid Drawing
- Appeal

At the end of this lesson you will use these 6 principles to refine the animation you have developed for Lesson 2 and you will expand upon your short story (created in Exercise 2.2), presenting it in the form of a comic strip.
