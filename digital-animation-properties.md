### Digital Animation Properties

In this section we will look into the basics of animation properties inside After Effects.

Every animatable element in After Effects has a few base properties that will define its animation. The most important properties are **position, scale, rotation and opacity**.

Here is a quick example of these properties in After Effects:

+ **Position** defines where the element is on screen over time.
+ **Scale** defines the size of the element over time.
+ **Rotation** defines the degree of rotation of the element over time.
+ **Opacity** defines the transparency of the element over time.

A **mask** is not an animation property, but masks are very important and are used extensively in motion design. They are a little bit different because they need two elements to work: the animation element (in the example above, the cube) and the mask itself (the rectangle that animates over the cube).

These properties cover pretty much all of the animations we will create, and when coupled with masks, they consist of the core of digital animation and motion design.
