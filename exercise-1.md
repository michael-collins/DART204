### Exercise 1

#### Guidelines

In this lesson you have learned 6 of the 12 basic principles of animation: 

1. Timing and Spacing
2. Ease in and Ease out
3. Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose
4. Squash and Stretch
5. Exaggeration 
6. Arcs

Now it is time to experience how they work in practice! 

In this exercise you will be given an After Effects file that you will use as a base to create your own animation of a bouncing ball.

To create this animation you need to focus on the principles of **timing, ease in and out and arcs**. You don’t need to add squash and stretch at this point, as we will be revisiting this animation in the next lesson.
